    <p class="big">With normal enumerations, enumerators are placed in the same scope as the enumeration itself, so you can typically access enumerators directly (e.g. red). However, with enum classes, the strong scoping rules mean that all enumerators are considered part of the enumeration, so you have to use a scope qualifier to access the enumerator (e.g. Color::red). This helps keep name pollution and the potential for name conflicts down.z</p>
